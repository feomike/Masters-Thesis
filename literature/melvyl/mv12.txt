AB: Abstract
    Environmental justice has grown out of a grassroots movement aimed
    at forging links between environmental decision-making, civil
    rights, and social justice. Public interest in environmental
    justice translates into the application of community organizing,
    coalition-building, and legal strategies developed in the civil
    rights movement to address a disproportionate burden of risk and
    exposure to pollution borne by low-income and minority
    communities. Currently, public interest activities in the US are
    most concerned with siting polluting facilities in low-income and
    minority communities, with the slow pace of contamination clean-up
    in these communities, and with the way in which environmental
    planning decisions are made. The federal response to these
    activities has included several pieces of proposed Congressional
    legislation (none of which have been enacted to date), and an
    Executive Order issued in February 1994 (Executive Order 12898,
    Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in minority
    Populations and Low Income Populations), directing each agency of
    the executive branch to determine whether administrative changes
    are needed to promote environmental justice goals. This paper
    reports on efforts undertaken to date by the US Department of
    Energy (DOE) to implement the Executive order. While DOE faces
    relatively few decisions about siting new facilities outside its
    current installations, in recent years the Department has begun a
    massive environmental restoration and waste management challenge.
    In addition the Department is responsible for carrying out the
    nation's energy policy, which allocates economic and environmental
    benefits and burdens.
